Battlegrounds received positive reviews from critics, who found that while the game had some technical flaws, it presented new types of gameplay that could be easily approached by players of any skill level and was highly replayable. 
The game was attributed to popularizing the battle royale genre, with a number of unofficial Chinese clones also being produced following its success. 
The game also received several Game of the Year nominations, among other accolades. 
PUBG Corporation has run several small tournaments and introduced in-game tools to help with broadcasting the game to spectators, as they wish for it to become a popular esport. 
The game has also been banned in some countries for allegedly being harmful and addictive to younger players.
